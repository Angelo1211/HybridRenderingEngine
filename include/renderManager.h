PURPOSE      : Setting up opengl, pre-processing data for rendering, shadow mapping, post processing 
               and shader initialization. It is the main interface that is called for rendering.
SPECIAL NOTES: This is the core of the program/project and where most of the work is still to be done.
               Starting with the static shadow mapping that we currently have implemented, that's 
               gotta change asap. The truth is I still have to wrap my head around how virtual texture
               tiling works before I can begin the refactor. There is also a pretty big argument to be made
               to move some of the shaders somewhere else, but that would probably be done best when
               the new material model comes in.
